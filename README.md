underscore.d.ts
===============

This is a typescript definitions file for underscore-1.4.4.js.

This definitions file can be found on https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped as underscore-typed.d.ts and additionally includes chained method support as well as jsdoc comments, this does make the definitions file considerably larger than the underscore.d.ts that is also available.
